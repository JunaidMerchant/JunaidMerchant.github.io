#### <span style="color:yellow">You can call me a *44 revolver* because that's how many times I'll have been around the sun.. </span>

## Let's party!

You don't need to bring anything except for openness and a good attitude! *(..and maybe any consumables/shareables you might desire)*

What you can expect: 

* First and foremost -- a great time!!
* Some food and drink, and lots of good company 
* Music, art, and inspiration
* Maybe some party favors and potential transformations
