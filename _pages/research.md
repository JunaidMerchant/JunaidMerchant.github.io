# <span style="color:darkred">Social Epidemiology</span> 

I have considerable experience with data management and analytics using large-scale datasets from the CDC, NIA, and NCHS. We've used these datasets in combination with multilevel modeling approaches to examine intersectional health inequities, and machine learning models for social media-derived social-contextual determinants of health.

**Increased incidence of pre-term birth and low-birth weight among racially minoritized mothers living in areas with higher racial animosity across ten years of National Vital Statistics System Natality (NVSS-N) data:**

My work uses achine learning models for social media-derived social-contextual determinants of health and data-rich visualizations.

**Mental health disparities among US high school students at the intersection of race, gender, and sexual orientation.** 

I am the lead investigator implementing multilevel modeling approaches to examine intersectional health inequities using I-MAIHDA (intersectional multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy). We uncovered a nuanced pattern of teen mental health inequities in the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Survey data, and provided insights into the groups most impacted by the disruptions that occurred during 2020.

# <span style="color:darkred">Social, Affective, and Cognitive Neuroscience</span>

I have a decade of experience in fMRI research examining social, affective, and cognitive processes in developmental, clinical, and aging populations.

## Computational Social Neuroscience

I am broadly interested in the neurocognitive processes underlying social interaction using computational modeling.
