I am a data analyst with the Big Data for Health Equity (BD4HE) team at the University of Maryland. My work investigates teen mental health using advanced multilevel modeling, novel data science applications, and large-scale public health datasets. Before I joined the Epidemiology and Biostatistics Department, my training was in psychology and I have over a decade of research experience in cognitive neuroscience. Throughout my career, I have been driven by an endless curiosity for understanding what makes people tick through cutting-edge approaches.
