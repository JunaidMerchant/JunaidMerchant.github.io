I am passionate about investigating the neurocognitive processes underlying social interaction using advanced computational modeling approaches!

## Representational Similarity Analysis

Understanding the relationship between neurocognitive processes through brain activity patterns.

## Our team won second place in the 2022 Computational Social and Affective Neuroscience Data competition

We investigatedwhether patterns of neural responses to faces of characters in a 45 minute-long dynamic film involving
multiple people (viewed in a variety of orientations, lighting, movement, and clothing) correspond to
representations of low-level visual features (e.g., visual similarity) and higher-level social features (e.g.,
social relationships) created from independent sources. We utilized Amazon's Rekognition, AlexNet, and novel data analysis approach to examine the representation of social networks in an episode of Friday Night Lights.

## Meta-analysis of Social Interactive Neuroimaging Studies

I'm in the processes of finishing up a large-scale meta-analysis of social interaction fMRI studies.
